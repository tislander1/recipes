<font color="green"><b>Dir: </b></font>&#8226; Saute onion, green onions, and garlic in olive oil until they're soft and lightly browned. Add spinach and parsley, then continue to saute until spinach is limp. Remove from heat and let cool. In a medium bowl, mix together eggs, ricotta, and feta. Stir into spinach mixture.<br>&#8226; Lay one sheet of phyllo dough in a lightly oiled 9x9 inch baking pan. Brush lightly with olive oil. Lay another sheet of phyllo dough on top, brush with olive oil, and repeat this process with two more sheets of phyllo. The sheets will overlap the pan. Spread the spinach and cheese mixture into the pan and fold overhanging dough over filling. Brush with oil, then layer with the remaining sheets of phyllo dough, brushing each with oil. Seal the filling with the overhanging dough.<br>&#8226; Bake for 30 to 40 minutes, until golden brown. Cut into squares and serve while it's still hot.<br></td></tr>
